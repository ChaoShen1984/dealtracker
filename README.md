# dealtracker

The project searches several different web sites gives the all the available deals. 
Purpose: Learn spring MVC (Thymeleaf), basic git commands, and web sraper.  

Future enhancement ideas: 
1. Sort
2. Show total page numbers
3. Show deal's picture
4. Pick which scrapers to use
5. tracking price change (this may not suit the purpose of the project. Just an idea.)
